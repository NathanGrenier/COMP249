# TODO
1. Change the int to long when validating the ISBNs. The split("") is also not working (returning an array with 1 extra empty element)
2. Check the other instances of split() (like the one with the regex)
3. Clean up the code (maybe make some functions for the repeated functionality / super nested blocks) 
4. Validate that the information in the binary files are actually correct.

# Generate Javadocs
- javadoc -private -d D:\Concordia\COMP249\Assignment3\Javadocs package Main package Exceptions     (Need to be in directory containing the class files / packages)
- Link to examples: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4592396/how-to-generate-javadoc-from-command-line
